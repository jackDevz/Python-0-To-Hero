UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THIS SOFTWARE BE USED FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES.

THIS SOFTWARE WAS ENGINEERED AS A LEARNING PROJECT AND SHOULD BE USED FOR
EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

ANYONE FOUND TO BE USING THIS SOFTWARE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES WILL BE REPORTED.



NOTE: For an extra level of security, I have disabled the function where this will scour the user's C drive...
The program will only search recursively from the folder in which the program was run. 
I have also chosen to only include the python scripts rather than the EXEs, to avoid script kiddies from getting
their hands on some potentially harmful software.
