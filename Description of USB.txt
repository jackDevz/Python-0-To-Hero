0.) User is strolling through car park/office and finds a pink USB stick on the floor... they proceed to pick it up.

1.) USB Stick with what appears to be a folder named "CV", but is actually a shortcut to a batch file within a hidden folder on the USB with 4 files.

Files: 
- Encryptor.exe
- TaskCreation
- TaskRemoval
- Task

2.) User clicks on the "CV Folder" which automatically runs the "TaskCreation.bat" file

3.) TaskCreation.bat creates a new folder in the user's documents called C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Windows_Update_64-bit  

4.) TaskCreation.bat then copies encryptor.exe, TaskRemoval.bat and Task.bat into the documents folder.

5.) TaskCreation.bat creates a task within the task scheduler that triggers on the 30th of the month, which executes the Task.bat file from the documents folder.

6.) Whilst waiting for 30th of the month to come around, you will need to plant as many of the rogue USBs around the office that will all repeat steps 1-5

7.) 30th of the month comes around, which triggers the task.

8.) Task.bat runs the encryptor which will recursively search the user's C drive and encrypt everything... ZIP folders, images, .docx, .txt...

9.) Encryptor.exe throws up a white window with text that explains you have fallen victim to a ransomware attack, provides a protonmail email address and wallet ID for you to send $XMR and transaction ID to.

9.) Task.bat then runs the TaskRemoval.bat which deletes the task so it stops it from running another time.

10.) When you receive the transaction ID through to your protonmail account, you can send them the Decryptor.exe which will need to be run on all affected machines
